# Enigma-Public
Simulation of the Enigma, an encoding machine used to encrypt and decrypt messages used during WWII by the German armed forces.

Per the Berkeley EECS policy, the source code for the project is in a private repository, which can be provided upon request (not if you're a current student! Believe me, you'll thank yourself for doing the work later)
